# gene-color-mapping
A project for CS294 - Computational Color class at UC Berkeley


Untitled5.ipynb is the ipython notebook for all our code. 

input_file is the raw data I used to generate the first spectra curve estimates (the current environment is using a direct function estimating the sensitivity curves so this file can probably be disregarded for now). 

seth.jpg and switzerland-hero.jpg are photos that I have used as inputs to the program. 
The results for these photos are test4.jpg and test2.jpg respectively.
